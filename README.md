Multiplayer Racing Game for Group Project Year3
C++ // Blueprint Unreal Couch Multiplayer Racing game for University. I did all aspects of the programming, from the UI to the audio programming to the gameplay.
I also recorded and implemented the audio for the Main Menu and all levels 
Controls are standard for racing games. Though the menu is built with navigation for the gamepad in mind
IT can be played with a keyboard however to fully appreciate force feedback implemented in the game it is recommended to use a controller for all aspects of the game.
